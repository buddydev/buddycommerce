Highly Flexible WooCommerce to BuddyPress integration which puts site admins in the complete control.

== Description ==
on a BuddyPress & WooCommerce site, BuddyCommerce helps listing user's orders, address, downloads etc on their BuddyPres profile.
You can integrate all or part of the functionality from WooCommerce account to BuddyPress profile.

It is a lightweight plugin aimed at providing quick and easy integration between BuddyPress and WooCommerce.

For each of the tab content you can configure:-
